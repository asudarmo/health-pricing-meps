# Decision log

Format: date, decision, why, alternatives considered. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-10-31 Data source is MEPS
Decision: US MEPS Household Component Full-Year Consolidated files plus event files.
Why: it is the only free person-level dataset with exposure, utilisation, paid costs and risk characteristics.
Alternatives: UK CPRD+HES (licence and fees), CPRD synthetic (no costs), NHS artificial HES (not
statistically realistic), CMS Marketplace PUFs (filed premiums, not claims), freMTPL2 (not health).

## 2026-10-31 Time periods and validation design
Decision: fit on 2022, validate out-of-time on 2023, and make the final refit on 2022+2023 pooled with a year
term. Add 2019 only if claimant counts are thin. Exclude 2020-21 because of COVID. Split within-year
hold-outs by household (`DUID`), because households appear in both survey years.
Why: validation goes forward in time, as in real pricing. Grouping by household avoids leakage.

## 2026-10-31 Trend
Decision: on-level severity with the price index AHRQ recommends for MEPS expenditure (confirm in M1).
Estimate frequency trend from the data (year term). State the assumptions and show low and high sensitivity.

## 2026-10-31 UK framing
Decision:
- PMI-scope claims only (inpatient/day-case, hospital outpatient/specialist, diagnostics)
- Report relativities rather than dollar levels
- Simulated UK product layer (excess, outpatient limit, underwriting type)
- Sex excluded from the final rating structure, and no race, income or education as rating factors
- Models fitted unweighted on exposure, with the survey weight `PERWT23F` used only for population sanity checks

## 2026-10-31 Code structure
Decision: notebooks for explanation, an installable package for all reusable logic, and versioned
aggregated output tables forming the contract for Phase 2 (plan section 6).

## 2026-10-31 MEPS variable shortlist and 2022-23 mapping (decision gate 1)
Decision: the shortlist and name mapping in `_docs/variable-mapping.md` is approved. BMI
(`ADBMI42`) is excluded from the pooled 2022+2023 model and the final rating structure, and is
used only in a 2022-only sensitivity analysis.
Why: `ADBMI42` and `CHBMIX42` exist in the 2022 Full-Year Consolidated file (HC-243) but no BMI
variable exists in the 2023 file (HC-251) under any name or round suffix, confirmed by grepping
both years' raw SAS program statement files. A factor only present in half the pooled data would
distort the pooled fit.
Alternatives: checking a separate 2023 PUF (such as Preventive Care) for a BMI variable, rejected
for now, can be revisited as a stretch goal if time allows.
